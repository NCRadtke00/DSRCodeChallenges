<!-- I'm going to start by recreating the painting in Figma. I'm going to use Figma as I don't have a lot of experience with it, and would like the practice. I would other wise use AdobeXD. I'm using tools like Figma or Adobe XD to greatly reduce the amount of time I spend guessing while styling web pages. If this is an issue please let me know, and I can better explain why I would almost always create a web-layout in Figma or Adobe XD if I'm not given one. -->
